The **C4P Diagnostics Toolkit** is a standalone executable designed to assist in the refurbishment and quality assurance of laptops. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various diagnostic tests, generating reports, and ensuring that laptops meet the required standards for donation or reuse.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This toolkit automates the process of testing and verifying key laptop components—hardware, software, and system configurations. It finishes with a clean-up process that removes setup files, generates a summary report, and prepares the laptop for deployment.

> 🔒 **Note:** This tool is specifically built to run on a fresh install of the **Dual Windows 10/11 C4P image**.

---

## ✨ Features

The executable includes the following embedded tools, extracted to a temporary directory during runtime:

- 🔋 **BatteryInfoView** — Detailed battery health reports  
- ⌨️ **KeyboardTester** — Test all keys, including function and special keys  
- 📶 **WiFiView** — Scan and view nearby WiFi networks  
- 📡 **BTView** — Scan and diagnose Bluetooth devices  
- 🖥️ **InjuredPixels** — Dead pixel and display quality test  
- 🔌 **USBDeview** — Test USB port functionality  
- 📜 **Custom PowerShell Scripts** — Gather system specs, battery data, and more

> All tools run seamlessly from the toolkit with no extra setup required.

## 🧹 Clean-Up Script (Final Step)

Executed after diagnostics, `Clean-Up.bat` performs:

1. 🗑️ **Deletes** temp files, scripts, and diagnostics tools  
2. 🔧 **Resets** Windows Update to "Notify before download"  
3. ⚡ **Enables** Hibernate & Fast Startup  
4. 🧠 **Applies** registry tweaks for optimization  
5. 🔁 **Restarts** Windows Explorer  
6. 🔄 **Reboots** system after notifying user  
7. 🧨 **Self-deletes** the script to leave no traces
